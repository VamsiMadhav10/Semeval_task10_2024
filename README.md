# Semeval_task10_2024
The EDiReF shared task at SemEval 2024 is an amalgamation of three subtasks tasks:

- (i) Emotion Recognition in Conversation (ERC) in Hindi-English code-mixed conversations. - (Zuhair)
- (ii) Emotion Flip Reasoning (EFR) in Hindi-English code-mixed conversations. - (Prasanna + Vamsi)
- (iii) EFR in English conversations. - (Rishi + Jahnavi)

The definitions for the tasks of ERC and EFR are as illustrated below:

- ERC: Given a dialogue, ERC aims to assign an emotion to each utterance from a predefined set of possible emotions.
- EFR: Given a dialogue, EFR aims to identify the trigger utterance(s) for an emotion-flip in a multi-party conversation dialogue.
